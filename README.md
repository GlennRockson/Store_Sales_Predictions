# Store_Sales_Predictions
This is a time series regression analysis, where models are built to predict sales or give forecast of sales for a grocery firm

# Aim and Objective
The primary focus of this project is to utilize time series regression analysis to forecast sales for Corporation Favorita, a prominent grocery retailer based in Ecuador.

The objective is to develop a robust model capable of accurately forecasting future sales by leveraging the extensive time series data of thousands of products sold across various Corporation Favorita locations. The resulting forecasts will provide valuable insights to the store's management, enabling them to formulate effective inventory and sales plans.

I will utilize the CRISP-DM framework to execute the project.
